Records data from the USRP bbprx (baseband pulse receiver) into an sqlite database.
Retains GPS info, raw pulse data and metadata.
Keeps track of radar mode, digitizing mode, retain mode.
Retain mode allows for storing only a subset of sweep data, presumably to
avoid recording clutter or regions of no interest.
