capture: start capturing radar data.
(use killcapture to stop capturing)

Call like so:

  capture [-d DECIM] [-n SAMPLES] [-p PULSES] [-c CHUNK_SIZE] [-r BEGIN:END]*

where:

  - DECIM is the decimation rate.  With the base clock rate of 125
    MHz,

      DECIM = 1  => range resolution = 1.2 metres
      DECIM = 2  => range resolution = 2.4 metres
      DECIM = 3  => range resolution = 3.6 metres
      DECIM = 4  => range resolution = 4.8 metres
      DECIM = 8  => range resolution = 9.6 metres

    These are the only sensible permitted values, currently.
    Default value: $DECIM

  - SAMPLES is the number of samples to capture per pulse.  When
    multiplied by the range resolution, gives the total range we
    capture out to.  Default value: $NUMSAMP

  - PULSES is max pulse per sweep.  Default value: $PULSES

  - CHUNK_SIZE is the number of pulses to transfer at a time.  This must
    divide evenly into PULSES.  Default value: $CHUNK_SIZE.

  - BEGIN:END specify portions of the circle to *not* capture.  BEGIN
    and END are both numbers in [0, 1]

       If BEGIN < END, pulses with azimuth in the range [BEGIN, END]
       are discarded.

       If BEGIN > END, pulse with azimuth in the ranges [0, END] and
       [BEGIN, 1] are discarded.

    i.e. all pulses in the clockwise sector from BEGIN to END are
    excluded

    The default, if no -r options is given, is to save all pulses.
    Multiple -r options are permitted, and a pulse is removed
    (discarded) if it belongs to any of the specified azimuth ranges.

    Note that azimuths 0 and 1 correspond to the same point, namely
    the start of the radar's heading pulse, i.e. when the beam is
    pointing toward the front of the radar unit.

This command starts the following processes:
 - a digitizing process on the local redpitaya / digdar digitizer, which
   must be on the local area network at address $DIGDARHOST

 - a capture process on this computer, which stores captured pulses in sweep files
   in a hierarchy of the form YYYY-MM-DD/HH/ under $DATADIR

 - a process to generate and push sweep images to the server at discovery.acadiau.ca

These processes are all stopped by the killcapture script.
The digdar digitizer and this computer commmunicate via a TCP connection on port $PORT.
